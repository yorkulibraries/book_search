    <p>The following common set of steps that will happen while we help you find this item:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Our system will receive a request from you.</li>
      <li>A staff member, who regulary checks incoming requests, will review your request and perform an initial search.</li>
      <li>If the item is found, it will be placed on hold for you at the Item location, circulation desk and you will be notified.</li>
      <li>If we can't find the item, we will ask another staff member to do another search. </li>
      <li>If the item is found, you know the rest.</li>
      <li>If we can't find the item after a second search, a coordinator will be asked to review this request.</li>
